🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using multiple linear regression.It includes *data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model building, and *model evaluation.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains housing-related features used to predict house prices. It includes numerical and categorical variables such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The target variable is the house price (continuous).
🛠️ Features

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
Preprocessing: Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes feature distributions, correlations, and relationships with the target variable.
Model Building: Implements multiple linear regression using scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

📋 Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn



Install dependencies using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

🚀 Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>


Prepare the Dataset:

Place the housing dataset (e.g., housing.csv) in the project directory.
Update the file path in the script if necessary.


Run the Script:

Execute the main Python script (e.g., housing_prediction.py) in a Jupyter notebook or Python environment.
Ensure the dataset is accessible.


Expected Outputs:

Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
Visualizations (e.g., correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, histograms).
Model performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²).
Predicted house prices for test data.



📊 Data

Source: User-provided housing dataset (e.g., Kaggle's Housing Prices dataset or similar).
Features: Examples include square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, year built, and location-based features.
Target: House price (continuous variable, typically in USD).
Preprocessing Steps:
Impute missing values (e.g., mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Scale numerical features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.



🧠 Model Architecture

Algorithm: Multiple Linear Regression.
Implementation: Scikit-learn's LinearRegression model.
Input: Preprocessed features (numerical and encoded categorical).
Output: Predicted house price.
Training: 80% train, 20% test split (adjustable).
Feature Selection: Optional correlation-based or statistical feature selection to improve model performance.

📈 Results

Visualizations: Insights into feature distributions, correlations, and price relationships.
Performance Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Provides error magnitude in the same units as the target.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.


Predictions: Accurate house price predictions based on input features (performance depends on data quality).

⚠️ Limitations

Assumes linear relationships between features and house prices, which may not always hold.
Sensitive to outliers and noisy data.
Performance depends on feature selection and data quality.
Does not account for external factors (e.g., market trends, economic conditions).

🔮 Future Improvements

Experiment with non-linear models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Incorporate advanced feature engineering (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features).
Add cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
Integrate external data (e.g., neighborhood demographics, interest rates).
